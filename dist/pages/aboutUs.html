                <h1>About Our Team </h1>

                <p>Westview Badminton team became an official sport at Westview High School in 2018. A group of students who were running the badminton club and were playing at state level, convinced the school authorities of their potential to be an official team and gathered enough interest int the student community that about a hundred students showed up for tryouts inn the first year itself. The scholl finally approved and the team was given a go.</p>
